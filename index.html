			<ul class="work-info_1">
				<li>In 1833, Lovelace was introduced to Charles Babbage, also known as the "Father of Computers", by her tutor, Mary Somerville. Since then a professional friendship between the young woman and Babbage ensued, and Ada became interested in the latter's 'Difference Engine.</li>
				<br>
				<li>In the year 1840, Babbage's lecture on his invention, the 'Analytical Engine', delivered at the 'University of Turin', was written in French by Italian, Luigi Menabrea. This paper was printed two years later, in the 'Bibliothèque universelle de Genève'.</li>
				<br>
				<li>After the publication, Lovelace took it upon herself to translate Luigi's French paper into English, after a request from Babbage's acquaintance, Charles Wheatstone. The paper was transcribed during 1842-43, and as an addition, the young lady included notes of her own analysis.</li>
				<br>
				<li>In 1844, she ventured on to design a model that would use mathematics to decode the neurological process involved behind the evolution of feelings, calling this "a calculus of the nervous system".</li>
				<br>
				<li>In 1844, Lovelace also went on to review a research publication on Animal Magnetism, written by Baron Karl von Reichenbach, but her work was never published.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Ada Lovelace was a brilliant mathematician, known mainly for the assistance she provided to Charles Babbage on his ‘Differential Engine’ and ‘Analytical Engine’. She wrote the world’s earliest algorithm for the ‘Analytical Engine’, which allowed the machine to calculate 'Bernoulli numbers'.</li>
